# Chinook

This application is unfinished. Please complete below tasks. Spend max 3 hours. We would like to have a short written explanation of the changes you made.

1. Move data retrieval methods to separate class / classes (use dependency injection)
2. Favorite / unfavorite tracks. An automatic playlist should be created named "My favorite tracks"
4. The user's playlists should be listed in the left navbar. If a playlist is added (or modified), this should reflect in the left navbar. There is already one playlist link in the Nav Menu as an example.
3. Add tracks to a playlist (existing or new one). The dialog is already created but not yet finished.
5. The user should be able to remove tracks from the playlist.
6. User should be able to rename the playlist
6. User should be able to remove the whole playlist
7. Search for artist name

When creating a user account, you will see this:
"This app does not currently have a real email sender registered, see these docs for how to configure a real email sender. Normally this would be emailed: Click here to confirm your account."
After you click 'Click here to confirm your account' you should be able to login.
